<p>This library contains structure long_number - a floating point type for long arithmetic.</p>

## Methots and operators of *long_number*
- Basic arithmetic operations, such as **+**, **-**, *, **/** are defined for *long_number* and have the same syntax as operations for built-in types;
- Comparison operators **>/</>=/<=/==/!=** are also defined for *long_number*;
- Method *ln_to_string* converts *long_number* to a string;
- Method **abs** returns the absolute value of *long_number*;
- Method **print_ln** prints *long_number*;
- You can construct long_number from long double, std::string, user-defined floating-point literal _ln. Default constructor creates 0.
